# FSE-2013-USMMC
This folder contains files and scripts used to build a virtual machine using Vagrant.  
This VM will contain the "USMMC" Tool and the "Process Analysis Toolkit" Tool.

A vagrant tutorial can be found [here] (https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/index.html)  
The binaries for vagrant can be found [here] (https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)  
The binaries and documentation for Oracle Virtual Box can be found [here] (https://www.virtualbox.org/) 

The USMMC tools web site is [here] (http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~lius87/UMLSM.html)

Follow this process to create the tool VM from scratch:  
1. Download all files/folders under the "build-vm" folder.  
2. Install Vagrant, if not already installed.  
3. Install Oracle Virtual Box, if not already installed.  
4. Open a command window.  
5. Navigate to the location where the files were downloaded.  
6. Type "vagrant up".  
7. After built, VM GUI will be displayed.
There might be a prompt to restart. 
Please wait until the vagrant window returns to a prompt before rebooting. 
The Virtual Machine also might reboot while it is being renamed.  

Please do not interact with the VM until all of the activity in the command window has completed.
